# Conclusion

 By analyzing the data and graphs, it becomes clear that the weekly holidays impact significantly in both store groups, high performance and medium performance. This indicates that low performance stores has a deficiency in acquiring clients, it can possibly either be a marketing deficiency or a problem related to the stores location.
 It can also be seen that type C stores were not the most rentable types, as they are concentrated in the low performance group. It can not be seen if there is a relationship between temperature and revenue, in case there is, it is not a relevante variable.
